The y axis shows the effect on air temperature, where negative values denote cooling of the air, and positive values denote warming of the air. Note: these values are relative to the reference material (concrete) as discussed previously.\n\nInspect the results, which show the median, p25, and p75 values. These can be aggregated by month, fortnight and week.\n\n\nAre canals having a cooling or warming effect during the daytime?\n\n\nHow does this vary seasonally?\n\n\n\n\nThe results above are based on analysis of 2022, which is still the warmest year on record in the UK (10.94°C), in series stretching back to 1884 (Kendon et al. 2023) and 1659 (Manley et al. 1974).\nDuring the summer, there were also extreme heatwaves on 15–17 June, 17–19 July and 9–15 August. Of these, the 17–19 July heatwave resulted in the UK’s highest ever recorded temperature, at 40.3°C (Witze 2024).\n\nIs there any of evidence of these heatwaves in the above plots? What does this do to the effects of canals on air temperature?\n\nWhile daytime effects are important, nighttime effects also need to be considered, for example due to the impacts of nighttime heat stress on human health (e.g., Sarangi et al. 2021)\n\nInspect the plot below, which showcases nighttime effects.\n\n\nAre canals having a cooling or warming effect during the nighttime?\n\n\nHow does this vary seasonally?

Local-scale adaptations, such as expansion or modification of greenspace, bluespace, or other aspects of urban design (e.g., building materials, albedo), can be used to mitigate against rising temperatures.\nIn today’s practical, we are going to explore a model that I developed alongside Dr. Harry Mcdonald (Engineering), Prof. Jonny Huck (Geography), and Prof. Joanne Tippett (Planning), plus support from the Canal and River Trust and generously supported thanks to funds raised by players of People’s Postcode Lottery, to investigate the effects of canals on urban temperatures.\nThe model and accompanying paper are not yet available, although you can read a conference article describing the model here.\nUnfortunately, the model is quite complex in structure and is relatively slow to run due to the scale of the analysis (i.e., modelling all of the urban canals in Great Britain and Ireland for the entirety of 2022 at 15-minute intervals), which precludes running the model within the practical.\nInstead, we’re going to explore the model approach, considering the structure, validation and initial results, focusing on the canals of Manchester. We’ll also explore the sensitivity of the model to changing inputs, including the degree of shading by nearby buildings and canal area, and model performance under changing climate.\nThis practical contains interactive maps and plots for you to explore and questions to reflect on, which are denoted by the following formatting:\n\nThis is an instruction.\n\nTo finish, there is a short formative quiz to test your knowledge as well as some additional tasks if you are interested in exploring this theme further.\n\nTo begin, explore Manchester’s canal network, and the nearby building geometries, which are one of the important model inputs.\n\n\nHow far do you live from the nearest canal?\n\n\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook"

    "text": "Approach\nBased on the above inputs, water temperatures are modelled incorporating evaporative, sensible (conductive and convective) and radiative (sunlight and thermal) heat fluxes between the water and the outside environment. Some heat fluxes that aren’t included are heat flux due to friction (\\(Q_{fc}\\)) or the advective heat flux (\\(Q_a\\)), which you can read about in Webb and Zhang (1997).\n\nWhy have these heat fluxes been excluded from the model?\n\nTo model these fluxes, the water column is split into different layers and at each time step, fluxes of energy are modelled between each layer and between the water surface and the surrounding environment. This is quite complicated.\n\n\n\nSchematic of the model structure\n\n\nTo complicate matters further, modelling of water (and its effects) is only one part of the model, which also considers the temperature and energy storage of a reference surface.\nThis is necessary because we need a baseline for comparison. The canal might have an effect on the surrounding air temperature (i.e., cooling or warming by x°C), but how do we assess the significance of this effect without comparing it to other materials e.g., concrete, asphalt, greenspace?\nIn our model, we use concrete as the reference material, which is a reasonable assumption for an urban environment, and could be the ultimate fate of some of our canals, an example below:\n\n\n\nThe former Kendal canal"

This is a key part of model evaluation - how do the results change as the inputs change?\nOne key input for the model is the degree of shading of the canal by nearby buildings.\nWhile these questions are important for model evaluation, they also have important consequences for the management, development and governance of urban areas. This is of particular relevance for Manchester, which has a rapidly developing skyline (see the Guardian):\nThe transformation of the skyline over the last 15 years is quite remarkable:\nWith construction of new office and residential buildings on brownfield sites (previously developed for industrial or commercial purposes), and on sites close to the canal network, there is potential for increased shading of our waterways. How will this influence water temperature and the effects of the waterways on air temperature?"

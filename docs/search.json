Not particularly insightful!\n\n\n\nHow has increasing the air temperature of the environment influenced the water temperature?\n\nIn the daytime, most cooling during spring, less during summer\nThe effect of increasing air temperature (on the effects of canals of air temperature) seems relatively small, but appears to decrease daytime cooling slightly.\n\n\nWhen it comes to warming water, solar intensity plays a significantly greater role than air temperature, as the direct absorption of sunlight by the water surface is the primary driver of heat gain, while air temperature primarily affects heat transfer through convection, which is usually less impactful than the direct solar radiation absorption.

Of these, the 17–19 July heatwave resulted in the UK’s highest ever recorded temperature, at 40.3°C (Witze 2024).\n\nIs there evidence of these heatwaves in the series?
